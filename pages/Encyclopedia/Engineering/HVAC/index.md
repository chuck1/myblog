=== APD ===

airside pressure drop of a coil for a given tube-fin configuration.

=== brine humidity control (official name?) ===

This is a method of controlling humidity and temperature by using a brine and a membrane.
Precise control of brine temperature changes amount of water vapor absorbed (released?) by brine.
Brine is LiCl and is very corrosive; designs use PVC and titanium.
This method is more efficient than the hot-gas-reheat method; think of it as
a straight line on the pcychrometric plot instead of an L shape.

### EER
### FLA
### hot gas reheat? (could be called something else)

method of controlling relative humidity and temperature by cooling past the design
temperature then reheating the air using some of the hot gas from the compressor.

Are there any examples of units at Huntair that use this? Is there a master database of
all units?

### LRA

### suction temperature

the temperature of the refrigerant entering the compressor

#### SST - saturated suction temperature

### evaporating temperature

average temperature of the refrigerant in the evaporator

### circuit

- in context of a system
	- a closed refrigerant loop
- in context of a heat exchanger coil
	- same as "feed"
	- a single refrigerant path from inlet to oulet

### SCFM

standard CFM

The equivalent volumetric flow rate of the air were at a
standard temperature and pressure (or altitude and dry bulb temperature).
Some organizations disagree on the standard used.

SCFM defines mass flow rate and is constant

### ACFM

actual CFM

The actual volumetric flow rate, changes with temperature and pressure.
Relevant to fan sizing because fans are positive displacement devices?

### Rad

overall thermal resistance of a dry coil (this is a function of 
face velocity and fins per inch) for a given tube-fin configuration

### Raw

overall thermal resistance of a wet coil (this is a function of 
face velocity and fins per inch) for a given tube-fin configuration

### THR

total heat rejected

heat transferred by condenser

### MBH

MBtu/hr

million btu per her?

### short cycle
### hot gas bypass
### low ambient conditions

### circuit ratio (serpentine)

example, 0.25 means every forth tube is a unique feed?

### wet-bulb temperature

[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature)

maybe?? the saturation temperature of water at the partial pressure of the the water vapor in air.
