== Background ==

We have seen demand for air-cooled condensers using R-410A as refrigerant.
Currently, Huntair can manufacture coils with minimum tube outer diameter of 0.5 inch.
We also have the option of purchasing the tooling for 0.375 inch tubes, which Mammoth used to produce for this application.
Any coils we produce must be pressure tested to meet UL 1995 requirements.

We have three options for air-cooled condensers using R-410A:

 * continue to purchase these condensers
 * bring 0.375 inch coil capabilities to Huntair
   * need to find proof of compliance with UL 1995 and create plan to maintain that compliance
   * source this tube material and validate its inner heat transfer and pressure drop 
 * determine required wall thickness for 0.5 inch OD grooved tube
   * perform strength tests for UL compliance
   * source this tube material and validate its inner heat transfer and pressure drop 

We need to gather information and determine the best option. See questions section.

We should also clearly present what kinds of coils have been produced at Huntair to-date. This will include tube wall thickness and inner surface treatment.

== Business Case For Building Condenser Coils At Huntair ==

For air-cooled condensers using R-410A, our only current option is to purchase these condensers from other manufacturers.
Could we save money by building these coils for this application at Huntair?

To calculate potential cost savings we need the following information:
 * projected quantity and specifications of these condenser coils
 * cost difference between buyout and in-house condensers
 * if 0.375 inch coils are considered, cost to bring this capability to Huntair
 * cost of testing for UL compliance

== Questions ==

 * See questions in business case section
 * air-cooled condenser coils with 0.375 inch OD tubes using R-410A
   * what testing was done by Mammoth to meet and maintain UL 1995 requirements?
 * as an example, what testing has been done to meet and maintain UL compliance for other types of condenser coils (evaporative condenser and condensers using other refrigerants)
 * fin die for 0.375 inch OD tube coils
   * what is the status?
   * what is the total cost to bring 0.375 inch coil capability to Huntair?
   * does the CDU/Rear Door project affect this?
 * what is the actual wall thickness of the 0.5 inch OD tube currently at the coil line at Huntair
 * how much will UL compliance testing cost for a single tube option?

== Option Details ==

=== 0.375 inch coils produced at Huntair ===

Mammoth has designs for air-cooled condensers using R-410A with 0.375 inch OD coils.

A fin die for 0.375 inch OD tubes was transferred to Huntair from Temtrol and sent out for refurbishing.
A decision has not been made as to whether or not this die will be refurbished and brought back to Huntair.
