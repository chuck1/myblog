Investigating which fin surfaces are AHRI certified before new testing.
Looking at coil engine code.
Appears that cold water coils are not certified for any amount of glycol.

From CWCoil, CheckForTemtrolSurfaces

 * if not Temtrol
   * 3/8 tubes are not certified
   * fin thickness less than 0.006. though I thought fin thickness didnt matter according to AHRI standard
   * old Temtrol enhanced not certified
   * if also not Mammoth
     * FPI greater than 14 not cert
   * if is Mammoth
     * FPI greater than 16 not cert
   * 1/2 tube, FPI less than 8 not cert
   * rifled tubes not cert
   * 1/2 tube, wall thickness greater than 0.025. though I thought wall thickness didnt matter according to AHRI standard
   * wall thickness less than 0.017. though I thought wall thickness didnt matter according to AHRI standard
   * fin height greater than 60. really? I thought that didnt matter.
   * 1/2 tube, fin length greater than 216

From CWCoil, Check2RCW. 1 and 2 row coils not cert.

"tubes left" greater than zero on coils with FH less than 30 and FL less than 60, which is the same as dropped tubes, not cert.
Why does this only apply to coils with FH less than 30?
Is it because of the relatively small surface area, making the dead tubes have more impact?
I wonder if there is anything in AHRI standard on this, not that I remember.
Should consider looking into this.

Fouling factor not cert. Why?

From CWCoil, CheckMinimumFinSurfaceTemp.
if fin surface temperature is below ARI requirement AND glycol percent greater than 0.
I dont remember a minimum fin surface requirement in AHRI, need to look.
Note that code above already says that we arent certified for any glycol.
