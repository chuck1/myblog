The tube-side heat transfer in the evaporating section of an evaporator coil depends on

 * tube geometry
   * inner diameter
   * inner wall surface, rifled or plain
 * mass flow rate
 * liquid to vapor density ratio of the fluid
   * dependent on saturation temperature
 
What variables can we change?

 * tube inner diameter
 * tube wall surface
 * tube length (number of passes)
 * mass flow rate
 * evaproator temperature (saturation temperature)
 * superheat

Which of these are geometry?

 * tube inner diameter
 * tube wall surface
 * tube length (number of passes)

Non-geometry variables

 * mass flow rate
 * evaproator temperature (saturation temperature)
 * superheat

However, the only evaporator coils I plan to design are 0.5 inch OD tubes with rifled inner walls.
So we may be able to afford to just test this.
Check with Venmar.
If we only test one tube geometry, we would only need to vary tube length, so one coil per tube length value we want to test.

== Conditioning ==

We will need to control

 * superheat
   * possibly by manually adjusting the TXV
     * O type Sporlan TEVs have externally adjustable spring, should be able to adjust sperheat during operation using this
 * saturation temperature
   * changing the overall heat transfer will set a new balance point and thereby change saturation temperature, but this is not idea because it is not independent. Need to figure out how much difference this would even make.
   * look into "evaporator pressure regulating valve"

== Info needed ==

Need information about piping and condenser and compressors so I can do balancing calculations.
