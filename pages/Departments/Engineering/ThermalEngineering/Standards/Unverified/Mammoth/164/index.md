== Compressor Discharge Lines ==

Refer to Suggestion #M671.

GUIDELINES:

 * FOR ALL REFRIGERATION PIPING, USE FORMED TUBING WHENEVER POSSIBLE RATHER THAN ELBOWS.
 * Reciprocating and Screw Compressors
   * The entire suction line requires either formed tubing or long radius elbows.  [DO NOT USE STANDARD (SHORT) RADIUS ELBOWS IN SUCTION LINES.] 
   * Formed tubing or a 90 deg long radius elbow is required within (2) feet of the compressor in the discharge line (between compressor and vibration eliminator).  See diagram below.
